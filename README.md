# Survival Analyis

Summary of models and especially their interpretation (graphically as well as content based) used in Survival Analysis. This document emerged throughout the exam preparation for a lecture on Survival Data Analysis at LMU in winter 2018. Most examples are based on that lecture taught by Prof. Kuechenhoff and Andreas Bender.
